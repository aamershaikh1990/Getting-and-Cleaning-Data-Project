## Data Source Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


## Raw data

The raw dataset includes the following files that were used:

- `features_info.txt`: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- `features.txt`: List of all features.

- `activity_labels.txt`: Links the class labels with their activity name.

- `train/X_train.txt`: Training set across the features.

- `train/y_train.txt`: Training labels.

- `train/subject_train.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample in the training set

- `test/X_test.txt`: Test set across the features.

- `test/y_test.txt`: Test labels.

- `train/subject_test.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample in the testing set

## Data Transformation Steps
- Read in all the activity labels 
- Read in all the feature vector labels
- Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements feature vectors from the training and testing data sets
- Add an additional column to name the activities using the descriptive activity labels from `activity_labels.txt` for both data sets 
- Merge the training and testing data sets together
- Melt the dataset by specifying activity ID, name and subject as the ID variables
- Recast the melted data set, producing an independent tidy data set with the mean of each variable for each activity and subject.
- Save the result as `tidy_data.txt`
