Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

Course Project for Cleaning and Getting Data 

##The following project carries out the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


##Running the script

- Clone this repository 
- Download the data set that can be found [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extract the folder within.
- This should yield a folder named *UCI HAR Dataset*
- Run the `run_analysis.R` script in the same working directory as `UCI HAR Dataset`
- The tidy dataset file will be outputted in the current directory being run. 
- Code book for the tidy dataset is availabe [here] (CodeBook.md)
